## üöÄ Features

- **Data Ingestion**
  Fetch historical price series (via `yfinance`) and compute returns.

- **Distribution Fitting** 
  MLE fitting of Normal, Student-t, GED, and Skewed-Normal; evaluates goodness-of-fit (K-S, AIC/BIC).

- **Risk Analysis**
  Static & rolling-window measures: VaR, CVaR, Sharpe, Relative‚ÄêPower Sharpe, Entropic VaR, Ulcer Index, Maximum Drawdown, Information Ratio, and more.

- **Dependency Modeling**
  Learn heavy-tailed Markov Random Fields for asset clustering under extreme co-movements.

- **Portfolio Optimization** 
  Static & epoch-based dynamic rebalancing with SLSQP and Trust-Region solvers; supports typical risk-return criteria.
